# MangaFox Scraper API - Unofficial New 2021

> This API provides basic functionality for searching and getting manga images from [MangaFox](fanfox.net) using `Nodejs` with `Puppeteer, Cheerio and ExpressJs`.

It has nothing to do with the official site, I just made it for fun and I will not be held responsible for any misuse of this.

## Description/Usage

### **Requests**

---

It has 2 valid endpoints:

1. **GET** `/manga/search/{name}/{page}` where page is defaulted to 1
2. **GET** `/manga/images/{name}/{chapter}`

{name} refers to mangafox name for the respective manga, which is contained in the response from the first endpoint (`/search`) : see _responses_

{chapter} is a chapter provided by the user which can range from 1 - last chapter ( see /search response for chapters) otherwise an error will be thrown

---

### **Responses**

---

> ### All responses are in `json` format except `404 not found` and `internal error` messages

1. ### **First endpoint (/search)**

```
{
    results : list[{}],
    itemsCount: int,    //per page
    pages : int
};
```

> **Each item in results is structured as follows**:

```
{
    displayName : str.
    name : str,             //necesary for getting the images
    cover : str,            //image link
    author: str,
    chapters : str,         //last chapter
    description : str,
    tags : list[str],
}
```
